# JAR-Template
A simple and powerful VexCode Pro V5 library featuring PID, odometry, and custom motion algorithms. (short for Jackson Area Robotics Template)

## Installation
1. Download the project by downloading the "JAR-Template-Pros.zip" file [here](https://github.com/j-ace-svg/JAR-Template-Pros/releases/latest).

2. Import the project in your PROS project by copying in all files from the JAR src/ and include/ directories to those of your project (it is recommended to back up your main.cpp and main.h files first).

3. First configure your robot using the graphical configurer, then follow the instructions in main.cpp to configure the template to your robot specs.

4. Check out the <a href="https://jacksonarearobotics.github.io/JAR-Template/" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more detailed tutorials and information on using the template (this fork is in no way endorsed by the original but the docs should be the same).

#### Original Credits
Developed by Josh, from 2775V of Jackson Area Robotics. Big thanks to Samuel from 2775V, Javier, Mikey, Ryan (4253B), Leo, JerryLum, and Nick (QUEEN) from VTOW and JPearman from the Vex Forum, whose assistance made this project possible.

#### Fork credits
Fork developed by John Montgomery, consulting programmer on a different robotics team. Most credit applies to the original coders, I just swapped out function calls and kept the api compatible with itself.

If you're interested in helping, Pull Requests and any sorts of technical suggestions are very much welcome. As little as I seem like I know, I know even less.
